# Enosis Fantastic

## Description

This is a Restful API using Flask and MongoDB.
The purpose of the API is user authentication using JWT.

* **Flask** is a lightweight web application framework designed to get results fast and leave room to make the app more detailed in the future.
   Here we do not having to follow a strict convention, hence it could accelerate the development process and gives developers the added flexibility.
   
* As a document database, **MongoDB** makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents. This format directly maps to native objects in most modern programming languages, making it a natural choice for developers, as they donâ€™t need to think about normalizing data. MongoDB can also handle high volume and can scale both vertically or horizontally to accommodate large data loads.
